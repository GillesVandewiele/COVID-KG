Dromedary camels have been implicated through reports that some victims have been exposed to camels, camels in areas where the disease has emerged have antibodies to the virus, and viral sequences have been recovered from camels in association with outbreaks of the disease among humans. Nonetheless, whether camels mediate transmission to humans is unresolved. Here we provide evidence from a geographic and temporal survey of camels in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that MERS coronaviruses have been circulating in camels since at least 1992, are distributed countrywide, and can be phylogenetically classified into clades that correlate with outbreaks of the disease among humans. We found no evidence of infection in domestic sheep or domestic goats.",

Phylogenetic analyses of 13 complete and 8 partial genome sequences enabled estimates of the timing and geographic origins of individual viral clades. The authors proposed that MERS-CoV emerged in humans in 2011 and noted that sequence divergence between clades is consistent with several sporadic introductions of the virus into the human population, presumably from an animal reservoir.",

Bats harbor a wide range of betacoronaviruses (7) ; furthermore, bat cell lines display the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (8) , and can be experimentally infected. A short sequence fragment consistent with MERS-CoV was reported in a bat in Bisha, KSA, collected in close proximity to the home and workplace of the 2012 index case patient from whom the initial virus isolate was obtained (9) . That same patient owned four pet dromedary camels (DC). Serological analysis of those DC revealed the presence of antibodies reactive with MERS-CoV; however, no MERS-CoV sequences were found by PCR analysis of nasal or rectal swabs or serum. Additional human cases have been associated with exposure to DC, and in some instances, investigators have described both serologic and genetic evidence of MERS-CoV infection in DC. Memish and coworkers reported PCR detection of MERS-CoV sequences in a DC with respiratory illness owned by an individual with MERS-CoV who had no history of contact with other infected humans (10). Haagmans et al. investigated an outbreak of the disease among humans on a Qatari farm and found MERS-CoV sequences in nasal swabs from 6 of 14 seropos-itive DC. Analysis of open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and fragments representing ORF1b, spike, and ORF4b revealed similarity but not identity to sequences obtained from the MERS-CoVinfected humans at the same farm. The authors provide evidence that MERS-CoV can infect DC but cautiously conclude that data are insufficient to determine whether the infection spread from DC to humans, from humans to DC, or via another host to both species (11) .",

Rectal and nasal swabs collected in parallel with serum samples from the same animals were assayed for MERS-CoV nucleic acids by RT-qPCR. Nucleic acids were most frequently detected in nasal swabs; rectal swabs were found positive in only three cases; in two of them, the nasal sample was also positive. The regional distribution of PCR-positive animals is shown in Fig. 1B . In contrast to serology, where MERS-CoV-reactive antibodies were more prevalent in adults than in juveniles (95% versus 55%), MERS-CoV nucleic acids were found more frequently in juveniles (36/104, 35%) than in adults (15/98, 15%) (P \u03ed 0.003, 2 test).

Analysis of specimens from western regions of the country, from Tabuk in the northwest, Taif in the west, and Gizan in the southwest, revealed regional differences. Although the seroprevalence was high in adults throughout the country at \u03fe80%, in juveniles, it ranged from 90% in the east to 5% in the southwest. The sero-prevalence in DC \u05452 years of age was lower than that in older animals, confirming the results of Hemida et al. (15) . Molecular analysis of nasal and rectal swab specimens indicated the highest prevalence of MERS-CoV sequences in DC in the west and northwest. Nasal swabs with heavy sequence loads (\u03fe10 5 copies) also clustered in the Taif region. A second sample collection in the west (Taif) separated from the first by an interval of 2 months confirmed the presence of heavy viral sequence loads in nasal swabs collected from juvenile animals sampled in this area (data not shown). These findings suggest that continuous, longer-term surveillance is necessary to determine the dynamics of virus circulation in DC populations. Lower prevalence rates of both MERS-CoV and Bo-CoV were evident in samples from the southwest. This may relate in part to the enforcement of restrictions of livestock movement in and out of Gizan Province implemented after the Rift Valley fever outbreak in 2000 but also to the generally lower DC population density in this region than in other regions of the KSA.",

Complete genomic sequences of MERS-CoV found in contemporary DC in the KSA are identical to sequences of viruses recovered from human MERS-CoV victims (unpublished data). Although we speculate that DC are potential reservoirs for human transmission, we cannot prove this relationship from the current data. Rigorous epidemiological investigation of the potential for exposure to DC in sporadic cases of MERS-CoV (those where there is no opportunity for human-to-human transmission) is required to test this model. If DC can be implicated, other questions will arise. Did MERS-CoV truly emerge as a human pathogen in 2012, or were cases of cryptic infection not appreciated because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tests? We may be able to address this conundrum by using archived human materials. If evidence of human MERS-CoV infections cannot be detected prior to 2012, we must entertain the possibility that mutation facilitated cross-species transmission. However, we see no path to address this possibility absent access to historical DC respiratory tract specimens. The only archived DC specimens we have been able to locate are DC sera; our efforts to recover MERS-CoV sequences from camel blood have been unsuccessful. What are the roles of bats, if any, as reservoirs of MERS-CoV? These limitations notwithstanding, the most urgent public health concern, raised in work we and others have reported that focuses on DC infection, is to determine the role of these animals in sporadic human infection. The evidence is clearly sufficient to support targeted investigation of direct or indirect exposure to DC in the disease among humans. ",

Two rectal and two nasal swabs were obtained from each animal. One rectal swab and one nasal swab were placed into RNAlater (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and one rectal swab and one nasal swab were placed into viral transport medium (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). All were stored at \u03ea80\u00baC. After 24 h in fixative, plates were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed in PBS for storage at 4\u00b0C. Plates were loaded with infected and noninfected cells in alternating rows to generate a differential reading for each serum tested. Positivity was defined as an infected-cell optical density of \u03fe0.6 and \u03fe3\u03eb the noninfected-cell optical density. Test sera were diluted 1:3,000 in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 -1% bovine serum albumin; secondary antibodies were rabbit anti-goat IgG (H\u03e9L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3,000; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), rabbit anti-sheep IgG (H\u03e9L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3,000; Bio-Rad), and anti-llama IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX).",

The nucleocapsid proteins of Bo-CoV and MERS-CoV were PCR amplified with primers introducing appropriate restriction sites for cloning into vector pREN-2 fused to the C terminus of the Renilla luciferase reporter (20) . Sequence-confirmed construct DNA was purified from Escherichia coli cultures (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and transfected into COS-1 cells (African green monkey kidney, ATCC CRL-1650; 1 g; Lipofectamine; Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100, 50% glycerol, protease inhibitors), and the protein extract was clarified by two rounds of centrifugation at 12,000 \u03eb g. The target concentration was determined in relative light units (RLU), and approximately 10 \u03eb 10 6 RLU were incubated with test serum (1:100) in a final volume of 100 l buffer A (50 mM Tris [pH 7.7], 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100) per well in 96-well plates (catalog no. 249944; Thermo/Nunc, Waltham, MA).

Bead-bound anti-gen was washed eight times with buffer A and three times with PBS (Tecan Hydroflex, Maennedorf, Switzerland) and then read with coelenterazine substrate (Renilla luciferase assay system; Promega, Madison, WI) on a Centro LB960 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany).",

The majority of infections have been identified in the KSA with lower numbers in Jordan, Qatar, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. Although cases have also been reported in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, all have been linked to the Middle East either by travel of the individuals infected through an area where MERS-CoV has been reported or by direct or indirect contact with others who have a travel history consistent with exposure in the Middle East (3).",
