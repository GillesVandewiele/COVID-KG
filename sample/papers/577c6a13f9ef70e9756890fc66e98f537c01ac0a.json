Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of expression. Our results indicate that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to replicate in bats without clinical signs of disease, supporting the general hypothesis of bats as ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV.",

Since then, more than 1600 human cases of MERS-CoV have been reported with a case-fatality rate of ~30% 2 . MERS-CoV cases were initially largely confined to six countries on the Arabian Peninsula: Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, and the majority of cases have been detected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2 . Travel-related cases have been identified in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America 3 .

A 190 nucleotide RNA fragment with 100% match to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of MERS-CoV was detected in a fecal sample of an Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforates) roosting in the vicinity of a MERS-CoV index case in Bisha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 20 . In addition, the detection of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in dromedary camels in the Middle East and northern and eastern Africa suggest the widespread circulation of MERS-CoV-like viruses in dromedary camels 21-27 .

Together, these data suggest that rather than direct zoonotic transmission from a bat reservoir, dromedary camels are involved as the primary reservoir host for MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic and epidemiological data suggest that rather than a single introduction in the human population, MERS-CoV appears to continue to be transmitted by multiple independent spillover events from dromedary camels 32, 33 .",

To understand the drivers of MERS-CoV emergence, a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the virus and its natural and intermediate reservoir hosts is needed. Here we present data on the first experimental infection of bats with MERS-CoV to model the infection kinetics in a coronavirus host species, the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis).",

The MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 is the main host restriction factor 34 ; therefore, we first studied the interaction between MERS-CoV and Jamaican fruit bat DPP4. The pAJ-DPP4 plasmid expressing the DPP4 coding sequence of Jamaican fruit bat under control of a CMV promoter was transfected into BHK cells, which are not permissive to MERS-CoV 34 . The expression of AJ-DPP4 in transfected cells was confirmed by flow cytometry, showing the presence of bat DPP4 on the surface of transfected BHK cells by determining the increase over untransfected cells ( Figure S1 ). Transient expression of bat DPP4 in BHK cells supported MERS-CoV replication, whereas transient expression of hamster DPP4 in BHK cells did not (Fig. 1A) . Subsequently, the replication kinetics of MERS-CoV were compared in LLC-MK2 cells (Macaca mulatta) and Jamaican fruit bat primary kidney cells. MERS-CoV replicated efficiently to high titers in both cell lines (Fig. 1B) , indicating that there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV replication in Jamaican fruit bat cells.",

Several aspects of the emergence of MERS-CoV are currently still unknown, including the role of the natural reservoir and the relationship between the natural and intermediate reservoirs. with their ability to support efficient replication of MERS-CoV, the availability of an annotated transcriptome 45 , and the relative easy housing and husbandry practices of Jamaican fruit bats suggest that this bat species can become an important model system to investigate the relationship between coronaviruses and their bat hosts 46 .

With batCoV-HKU4, a closely related coronavirus, it was shown that replication in human cells required two mutations in the spike protein 48 . These amino acid residues, which are conserved in MERS-CoV, results in the activation of the batCoV-HKU4 spike protein by human cellular proteases. This suggests that batCoV-HKU4 needs these residues for replication in humans. Interestingly, our data show that MERS-CoV replicates efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting that the MERS-CoV spike can efficiently be processed by Jamaican fruit bat cellular proteases and that there is no host restriction on the post-translational modification level of the MERS-CoV spike in dromedary camels, humans and bats.",

            "text": ". The ability of MERS-CoV and batCoV-HKU4 to evade this innate immune sensing must have evolved in the reservoir bat host, and may therefore have benefitted the virus by limiting the bat immune response without negatively impacting the population level of the bat host. The modest, transient upregulation of Mx1, ISG56 and RANTES observed in Jamaican fruit bats may permit MERS-CoV replication without causing clinical signs. The transient nature of the MERS-CoV infection suggests that the virus is cleared by immune mechanisms, but the isolation of MERS-CoV in the duodenum of bat 10 at 28 dpi indicates that the virus might persist at low levels for a longer period of time. The limited seroconversion observed in the Jamaican fruit bats suggest that the immunogenicity of the MERS-CoV proteins in the context of experimental infection in bats in absence of clinical signs is very low.

Oral and rectal swabs were collected at exam and necropsy dates. RNA was extracted and qRT-PCR was performed. Viral load was expressed as TCID 50 equivalents.Scientific RepoRts | 6:21878 | DOI: 10.1038/srep21878 seroconversion was observed in clinically ill patients between 21 and 28 days after infection with MERS-CoV with titers between 80 and 320 53 . Limited seroprevalance was observed in healthy people with a high occupational risk for MERS-CoV exposure (shepherds and slaughterhouse workers), combined with the extensive circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels this suggests that unrecognized infections that cause no or mild symptoms might result in no to limited seroconversion22,54 .Although of considerable interest, the number of experimental infection studies in bats are limited. Experimental bat infection studies have been performed with coronavirus bat intestine samples derived from field studies18 , Nipah virus and Hendra virus 55,56 , Tacaribe virus 57 , Ebola virus and Marburg virus 58,59 and the majority of experimental infection studies have been performed with Lyssaviruses60 . In these studies replication, shedding, morbidity and mortality varied greatly. Severe morbidity and mortality were observed after inoculation of Jamaican fruit bats with Tacaribe virus and rabies virus 57,61 ; Jamaican fruit bats are the presumed host reservoir for both viruses. After oral inoculation of Leschenault's Rousette bats (Rousettus leschenaulti) with homogenates of intestinal tract samples obtained from bats caught during field studies in the Philippines and positive by PCR for a group 2 Betacoronavirus (closely related to MERS-CoV) no clinical signs were observed, but replication and limited virus shedding were observed in and from the intestinal tract18 . Our experimental infection data show that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to efficiently replicate in a bat host. In our bat infection model all Jamaican fruit bats became infected with MERS-CoV in the absence of clinical signs. This supports the hypothesis that bats are the ancestral reservoir for MERS-CoV. In addition, it highlights the host-range plasticity of MERS-CoV, and potentially of those of highly related coronaviruses circulating in bat population.Materials and MethodsEthics Statement.
