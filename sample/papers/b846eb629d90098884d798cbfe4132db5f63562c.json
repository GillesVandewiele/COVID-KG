The open reading frame (ORF) 1a gene was used for confirmation as recommended by the World Health Organization(www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_ infections/MERS_Lab_recos_16_Sept_2013.pdf?ua=1). We also used a previously described pan-CoV nested PCR targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region (13) , and PCR products were analyzed by sequencing (online Technical Appendix, wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/20/6/14-0299-Techapp1.pdf). We detected MERS-CoV RNA in 4 (3.6%) of 110 nasal swab specimens from dromedary camels with the upstream of E gene assay (cycle threshold [C t ] 23.2-36.8), confirmed by the ORF1a assay (C t 23.2-39.1), fulfilling the World Health Organization criteria for diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection (Table 1) . PCR was repeated from a fresh RNA extract to confirm positive results. One positive sample was obtained from a camel in an abattoir in the Nile Delta region in November 2013 and 3 other samples from an abattoir in Cairo in December 2013. Virus culture attempts in Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) so far have been unsuccessful. The pan-CoV nested PCR detected CoV in an additional 8 specimens from dromedary camels. Sequence analyses of these additional positive samples showed that these amplicon sequences were genetically similar to those of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (>99% nucleotide similarity). No animal was co-infected with MERS-CoV and BCoV-like viruses. The animals positive for either MERS-CoV or BCoV-like virus were all imported from Sudan or Ethiopia for slaughter. On phylogenetic analysis, the partial RdRp sequences from MERS-CoV-positive samples NRCE-HKU205 and NRCE-HKU270 grouped within the cluster of MERS-CoV ( Figure 1 ). The viral load in the other 2 specimens was too low to provide amplicons suitable for genetic sequencing. Viral RNA from NRCE-HKU205, the first positive specimen detected, was selected for more detailed genomic sequencing. We amplified viral RNA by PCR, using primers specific for overlapping regions of human MERS-CoV genome. PCR products were sequenced and assembled to produce a near full-length genome, lacking only the 3\u2032 untranslated region (29908 nt, >99% of the MERS-CoV genome) (online Technical Appendix). The camel MERS-CoV genome has an overall nucleotide similarity of 99.2%\u221299.5% and deduced amino acid similarity of 98.0%-100% to ORFs of human MERS-CoV EMC/2012 ( Table 2 ). The 5\u2032 untranslated region and internal transcriptional regulatory sequences of NRCE-HKU205 were identical to published human MERS-CoV sequences.",

Of these, only residue 434 falls within the proposed receptor binding domain of spike protein, but it is located at the core (stem) subdomain of the receptor binding domain, suggesting that the camel MERS-CoV is still likely to bind human CD26 (online Technical Appendix Figure) .

The detection of MERS-CoV in nasal swab specimens of camels in 2 of 12 sampling occasions in abattoirs, taken together with the high seropositivity to MERS-CoV in dromedaries previously reported, supports the contention that MERS-CoV infection is common in dromedaries. Studies of dromedaries within camel herds and through the animal marketing system supplying abattoirs are needed to define the epidemiology of the infection. Our findings strengthen the plausibility that dromedaries may be a potential source of human infection and emphasize the need for detailed epidemiologic investigation of the exposure histories of humans with MERS. However, the lack of serologic evidence of infection of humans working in these abattoirs suggests that transmission of this virus to humans is uncommon. The detection of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in Egypt, in animals imported from Sudan and Ethiopia, suggests that cases may occur in humans beyond the Arabian Peninsula. MERS CoV diagnostic tests should be considered for all patients with unexplained severe pneumonia in Egypt, northeastern Africa, and beyond. ",

The viral RdRp region analyzed is a highly conserved region of the genome (covering motif B of RdRp) in nonstructural protein 12, at position 15202-15582 of MERS-CoV genome. The partial RdRp sequence of NRCE-HKU205 (GenBank accession no. KJ477102) and NRCE-HKU270 (GenBank accession no. KJ477103) was aligned with human MERS-CoVs (GenBank accession nos.

Bat CoV HKU5-1 and bat CoV/PML/Neo cf. zul/RSA/2011 were included in the analysis as outgroups because they are phylogenetically closest to MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using MEGA5 (14) with neighbor-joining method. Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values determined by 500 replicates. Only bootstrap values >70 are denoted.
