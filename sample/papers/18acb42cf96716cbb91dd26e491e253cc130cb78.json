Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat fecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses the ACE2s from human, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.",

SARS-CoV was shown to use the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) molecule as its entry receptor, and this is considered a hallmark of its cross-species transmissibility 11 . The receptor binding domain (RBD) located in the N-terminal region (aa 318-510) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is directly involved in binding to ACE2 12 . However, despite phylogenetic evidence that SARS-CoV evolved from bat SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), all previously identified SL-CoVs have major sequence differences from SARS-CoV in the RBD of their S proteins, including one or two deletions 6, 9 . Replacing the RBD of one SL-CoV S protein with SARS-CoV S conferred ability to use human ACE2 and efficiently replicate in mice 9, 13 . However, to date, no SL-CoVs have been isolated from bats, and no wild-type SL-CoV of bat origin has been shown to use ACE2.",

The species origin of all positive samples was confirmed to be Rhinolophus sinicus by cytB sequence analysis as described previously 16 . A higher prevalence was observed in samples collected in October (30% in 2011 and 48.7% in 2012) than those in April (7.1% in 2011) or May (7.4% in 2012) (Extended Data Table 1 ). Analysis of the S protein RBD sequences indicated the presence of seven different strains of SL-CoVs (Fig.  1a , Extended Data Figure 1 and 2). In addition to RBD sequences which closely matched previously described SL-CoVs (Rs672, Rf1 and HKU3) 5, 8, 17, 18 , two novel strains (designated SL-CoV RsSHC014 and Rs3367) were discovered. Their full-length genome sequences were determined and both are 29,787-bp in size (excluding the polyA tail). The overall nucleotide sequence identity of these two genomes with human SARS-CoV (Tor 2 strain) is 95%, significantly higher than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China (88-92%) 5, 8, 17, 18 or Europe (76%) 6 (Extended Data Table 2 and Extended Data Figure 3 and 4). Higher sequence identities were observed at the protein level between these new SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs (Extended Data Table 3 and 4) . To understand the evolutionary origin of these two novel SL-CoV strains, we conducted recombination analysis with the Recombination Detection Program 4.0 package 19 using available genome sequences of bat SL-CoVs strains (Rf1, Rp3, Rs672, Rm1, HKU3, and BM48-31) and human and civet representative SARS-CoV strains (BJ01, SZ3, Tor2, and GZ02). Three breakpoints were detected with strong P-values (<10 \u221220 ) and supported by similarity plot and bootscan analysis (Extended Data Figure 5A and B). Breakpoints were located at nt 20,827, 26,553, and 28,685 in 3367 (or SHC014) genome, and generated recombination fragments covering nt 20,827-26,533 (5,727 nt) (including partial ORF 1b, full-length S, ORF3, E and partial M gene) and nt 26,534-28,685 (2,133 nt) (including partial ORF M, full-length ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and partial N gene). Phylogenetic analysis using the major and minor parental regions suggested that 3367 or SHC014 is the descendent of a recombination of lineages that ultimately lead to SARS-CoV and SL-CoV 672 (Fig. 1b) .",

Our previous work provided phylogenetic evidence of this 5 , but the lack of an isolate or evidence that bat SL-CoVs can naturally infect human cells, until now, had cast doubt on this hypothesis. Secondly, the lack of capacity of SL-CoVs to use of ACE2 receptors has previously been considered as the key barrier for their direct spillover into humans, supporting the suggestion that civets were intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV adaptation to human transmission during the SARS outbreak 24 . However, the ability of SL-CoV-WIV1 to use human ACE2 argues against the necessity of this step for SL-CoV-WIV1 and suggests that direct bat-to-human infection is a plausible scenario for some bat SL-CoVs. This has implications for public health control measures in the face of potential spillover of a diverse and growing pool of SARS-like CoVs with a wide geographic distribution.",

The high genetic diversity of SL-CoVs within this colony was mirrored by high phenotypic diversity in the differential use of ACE2 by different strains. It would therefore not be surprising if further surveillance reveals a broad diversity of bat SL-CoVs that are able to use ACE2, some of which may have even closer homology to SARS-CoV than SL-CoV-WIV1. Our results, the recent demonstration of MERS-CoV in a Saudi Arabian bat 25 , and of bat CoVs closely related to MERS-CoV in China, Africa, Europe and North America 3,26,27 , suggest that bat coronaviruses remain a substantial global threat to public health.",

The potential recombination events suggested by RDP due to their strong Pvalues (<10-20) were further investigated by similarity plot and bootscan analyses implemented in Simplot 3.5.1. Phylogenetic origin of the major and minor parental regions of the 3367 or SHC014 were constructed from the concatenated sequences of the essential ORFs of the major and minor parental regions of selected SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs. Two genome regions between three estimated breakpoints (20,827-26,553, and 26,554-28,685) were aligned independently using ClustalX and generated two alignments of 5,727 bp and 2,133 bp. The two alignments were used to construct maximum likehood trees to better infer the fragment parents. All nucleotide numberings in this study are based on 3367 genome position. Detection of potential recombination events. Similarity plot (a) and bootscan analysis (b) detected three recombination breakpoints in the bat SL-CoV Rs3367 or SHC014 genome. The three breakpoints were located at ORF1b (nt 20,827), M (nt 26,553) and N (nt 28,685) gene, respectively. Both analyses were performed with an F84 distance model, a window size of 1,500 bp and a step size of 300 bp. The ORFs in the genome were predicted and potential protein sequences were translated. The pairwise comparisons were conducted for all ORFs at nucleotide acids (nt) and amino acids (aa) levels. The s2m were compared at nt level. TRS: Transcription regulating-sequences; N/D, not done; N/A, not available. a, SARS-CoV S protein aa residues 310 to 520 were aligned with homologous regions of bat SL-CoVs using the ClustalW software. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using Poisson model with bootstrap values determined by 1,000 replicates in the MEGA5 software package. The RBD sequences identified in this study are in bold and named by the sample numbers. The key amino acids residues involved in interacting with human ACE2 molecule are indicated on the right of tree. SARS-CoV GZ02, BJ01 and Tor2 were isolated from patients of early, middle and late phase, respectively, during the SARS outbreak in 2003. SARS-CoV SZ3 was identified from Paguma larvata in 2003 collected in Guangdong, China. SL-CoV Rp3, Rs_672 and HKU3-1 were identified from Rhinolophus Virions from a 10-ml culture were collected, inactivated and concentrated/purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The pelleted viral particles were dissolved in 100 \u03bcl PBS, stained with 2% phosphtungstic acid (pH 7.0) and examined directly using a Tecnai transmission electron microscope (FEI) at 200 kV. Determination of virus infectivity in HeLa cells with and without the expression of ACE2 (abbreviations: h, human; c, civet; and b, bat). ACE2 expression was detected with goat anti-humanACE2 antibody followed by FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG. Virus replication was detected with rabbit antibody against the SL-CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein followed by Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG. Nucleus was stained with DAPI. The columns (from left to right) show staining of nuclei (blue), ACE2 expression (green), virus replication (red), merged triple-stained images and real-time PCR results, respectively. (n = 3). Error bars represent standard deviation. ",
