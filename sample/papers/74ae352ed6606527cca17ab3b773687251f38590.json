We inoculated 3 adult camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV and a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but each of the camels shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract. We detected infectious virus in nasal secretions through 7 days postinoculation, and viral RNA up to 35 days postinoculation. The pattern of shedding and propensity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dromedary camels may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camels and the means of efficient camel-to-camel and camel-tohuman transmission.",

Anecdotal reports mentioned contact of MERS-CoV-infected patients with camels and goats, suggesting that livestock might be the intermediate reservoir host for MERS-CoV (4,10-12). Serologic studies revealed widespread prevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in dromedary camels from several countries that reported MERS cases (4, (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Further, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples obtained from 3 camels on a farm linked to 2 human MERS-CoV cases, and the virus was isolated from nasal swab samples from dromedary camels in Qatar (14) . MERS-CoV isolation and subsequent full genome sequencing directly linked a dromedary camel and a fatal MERS-CoV case in a person in Saudi Arabia (20, 21) . Despite these associations, the role of camels as a primary reservoir for MERS-CoV is still debated (22, 23) . Here we report on the experimental inoculation of 3 camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV.",

Animals were housed in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 facility for the duration of the experiment and fed ad libitum. Camels were acclimated to the facility for 2 weeks before virus inoculation. We sedated the camels with xylazine, then inoculated them with a total dose of 10 7 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV (strain HCoV-EMC/2012) in a total volume of 15 mL, by way of intratracheal (8 mL using transcutaneous catheter), intranasal (3.3 mL in each nostril by expulsion from a syringe), and conjunctival (0.2 mL in each conjunctival sac) routes. The routes of inoculation and infectious dose were chosen to reflect a combination of most likely routes of exposure and to increase the potential of infection. The animals were observed at least 1\u00d7 daily for the duration of the experiment for behavior, food consumption, activity level, and nasal discharge. Rectal temperature was taken daily from 2 to 7 days postinoculation, then 3\u00d7 weekly until the animals were euthanized. Nasal and oral swab samples and fecal samples were collected into virus transport medium or virus lysis buffer daily from 0 to 7 days postinoculation (dpi), then 3\u00d7 weekly until the animal was euthanized. Blood was collected into evacuated EDTA and serum-separating tubes daily at 0-7 dpi and 3\u00d7 weekly thereafter. Urine was collected by convenience and at necropsy. To evaluate whether virus is exhaled from infected camels, a funnel was placed over the muzzle of each camel and connected to a vacuum pump to capture exhaled air in tissue culture media (10 mL Dulbecco modified Eagle medium, 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.013% SE-15 (anti-foam) with an All Glass Impinger (Ace Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ, USA).

Infectious virus was detected in tissues of the upper respiratory tract (URT), including nasal turbinates, olfactory epithelium, pharynx, and larynx. In the lower respiratory tract, infectious virus was detected in the trachea and in 1 of 4 lung lobes tested. Infectious virus was also detected in the retropharyngeal, mediastinal, mesenteric, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes (Figure 4 ). On necropsy of camel 1 at 5 dpi, histologic lesions were found in the pseudostratified epithelial cells in the URT and the lower respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles) but not in the alveoli ( Figure  5) . The lesions were characterized as mild to moderate acute intraepithelial and submucosal inflammation with multifocal necrosis and loss of pseudostratified epithelial cells, comparable to the common cold among humans. Multifocal loss of epithelial polarity and cilia with squamous metaplasia were observed. The epithelium was infiltrated by small-to-moderate numbers of neutrophils with fewer macrophages; similar inflammatory cells also permeated the submucosa. The submucosal glands of the trachea were multifocally necrotic and infiltrated by small numbers of neutrophils. Viral antigen was detected within the epithelial cells of the nasal turbinates, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, but not the alveoli. In addition, viral antigen was present at the follicular mantle zone of the tonsils and mediastinal and retropharyncheal lymph nodes ( Figure 5 ). The nasal turbinates, larynx, and trachea of camel 2 (necropsied at 28 dpi) had similar but milder lesions when compared with those of camel 1. The nasal turbinate, larynx, and bronchus showed small numbers of infiltrating neutrophils; however, in contrast with the condition of camel 1, the cilia and goblet cells were intact. The remainder of the respiratory tract of camel 2 was unaffected. Immunohistochemical testing revealed the presence of limited viral antigen in the nasal turbinate but not in any of the other tissues at that time. No lesions or viral antigens were detected in camel 3 at 42 dpi.",

To understand the ecology of MERS-CoV in the most likely reservoir host, we experimentally inoculated 3 young adult dromedary camels with MERS CoV. The disease observed was clinically benign, in agreement with the absence of overt illness reported from field surveillance studies (14, 17, 19, 21) . A large quantity of MERS-CoV and viral RNA was detected in nasal swab specimens from each of the 3 camels.

            "text": "The study reported here was done on the basis of inoculation of 3 male animals with a human isolate of MERS-CoV, and the study design we used imposed several limitations on how these data inform what occurs in natural infections. The camels we inoculated were exposed to a high dose of virus by 3 simultaneous routes of inoculation. In retrospect, the inoculation dose does not seem excessive, based on the large quantity of virus shed nasally in all 3 animals ( Figure 2 ). The total dose inoculated was relatively equivalent to the amount of virus present in a single nasal swab sample taken during the first days postinoculation, and it seems probable that a camel shedding this quantity of virus would readily infect other camels or humans with which it had direct contact. The fact that we inoculated the camels with the virus by 3 routes precludes drawing conclusions regarding efficiency of transmission by a particular route, which is a topic that should be addressed in future studies. The influence of camel age on susceptibility and dynamics of virus shedding is another notable parameter that requires further study. It seems likely that productive infection and shedding of virus in natural settings occurs predominantly in juvenile camels (28) . This could be the result of an intrinsic difference in age-related susceptibility, but is more likely related to the immunologically na\u00efve status of the animals in the context of a high force of infection after decay of passively acquired antibodies. The animals we infected were young adults, but were seronegative and therefore probably as susceptible as juveniles from MERS-CoV-endemic regions. Another aspect of pathogenesis not addressed here is whether virus is present in milk or meat from infected camels and thereby poses another potential route of exposure to humans who consume such products. Despite these limitations, the magnitude and pattern of virus shedding was essentially identical in all 3 animals and supports the available epidemiologic data indicating that camels are likely a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV. Additional experimental and field studies are clearly required to address the duration of shedding of infectious MERS-CoV from infected camels, to determine whether infection results in protective immunity, and to clarify the burden of illness among humans resulting from transmission from camels.
