## Installing the requirements

Generating the COVID KG requires a few dependencies. Firstly, Python 3 should be installed with the following libraries:
```
SPARQLWrapper
nltk
numpy
pandas
requests
scipy
sklearn
tqdm
```

Further, to run RML, you will need:
* to have a recent version of Node.js and install the following dependency: `npm i @rmlio/yarrrml-parser -g`
* a recent Java version, and [RMLMapper](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java)

## Downloading the data

The dataset can be retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). After downloading the dataset, re-arrange the files to have the following directory structure:
```
data
|-metadata.csv
|-papers
  |-<PAPER_1>.json
  |-...
  |-<PAPER_N>.json
```

## Preparing the JSONs

### Create a sample dataset (OPTIONAL)
Make sure you have a directory called `sample` with a `papers` directory in there. Then run `python3 scripts/generate_sample_data`.

### Create bag of words of the content
To create a bag of words for title, abstract and body, run `python3 scripts/create_bow.py <INPUT_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR>`. As an example, you could run: `python3 scripts/create_bow.py sample output`.

### Mapping the string representations to known resources
Run `python3 scripts/map_entities.py <INPUT_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR>` to generate different pickled dictionaries with the following structure: `{string: URI}`.

## Running RML

After preparing the JSONs, we can convert them to RDF using RML. To do this, run:
```
yarrrml-parser -i rules.yml -o rules.rml.ttl
java -jar /path/to/rmlmapper.jar -m rules.rml.ttl
``` 

## Linked Data Fragments endpoint

We are hosting an endpoint that can be used for querying [here](https://query-covid19.linkeddatafragments.org/). The corresponding repository for this can be found [here](https://github.com/rubensworks/covid19-web-query-client).
